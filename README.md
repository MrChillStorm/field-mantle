# Field Mantle

**High-performance fabric wax for weatherproofing, abrasion resistance, and field conditions.**

Field Mantle is a rub-on wax blend specifically designed for outdoor and tactical fabrics. It offers lasting water repellency and fiber protection without relying on synthetic coatings that may flake or wash away. The formula is a balanced blend of **beeswax, paraffin, and carnauba wax**, which provides excellent weatherproofing, durability, wash resistance, and dirt repellency.

## Why This Blend Works

- **Beeswax** – Creates a natural, flexible waterproof layer.
- **Paraffin** – Penetrates deeper into fibers, improving flexibility and boosting water repellency.
- **Carnauba Wax** – Hardens the finish, improves abrasion resistance, and extends service life.

Unlike many commercial wax treatments that tend to attract and hold dirt, accelerating fabric wear through abrasion, Field Mantle’s carefully balanced blend creates a durable, smooth coating that resists dirt buildup. This reduces fabric abrasion and prolongs garment life, even in harsh field conditions.

The result is a coating that:
- Repels water effectively — even after multiple machine washes at 30 °C (without fabric softener).
- Withstands field abrasion better than beeswax-only formulas.
- Remains flexible in cold weather yet resists softening in heat.
- Minimizes dirt adhesion, preventing accelerated fabric wear.

## Making a Batch

> **Safety note:** Always use a double boiler — never melt wax directly over a flame.

For easy calculation of ingredient quantities based on your desired batch size,

1. **Ingredients** (by weight):
   - 50% Beeswax
   - 25% Paraffin
   - 25% Carnauba Wax

2. **Steps**:
   1. Add all ingredients to a double boiler.
   2. Heat gently until fully melted.
   3. Stir thoroughly to ensure a uniform blend.
   4. Pour into silicone muffin molds (or other heat-safe molds).
   5. Allow to cool and solidify before storage.

> **Cleanup Note:**
The wax blend hardens into a tough, almost rock-like finish that clings stubbornly to cookware and tools. Because of this, cleanup can be challenging and requires some elbow grease. It's highly recommended to use dedicated equipment—such as a double boiler for melting and separate stirring utensils—to avoid cross-contamination.

> Pouring into flexible silicone molds helps prevent stuck residue. For cleanup, a stainless steel scourer is your best ally and will remove most buildup. However, some wax remnants may persist despite your efforts—the very durability that makes this wax excellent for field use also makes cleanup a test of resolve.

## Application

1. **Rub** a thin, even layer of Field Mantle onto the fabric surface.
2. **Heat** the treated area with a heat gun until the wax fully melts into the fibers.
3. **Cure** by placing the garment in a 100 °C sauna for 4 hours.
4. Allow to cool completely before use.

### Why Sauna Curing?

**The 4-hour sauna curing at 100 °C helps the wax fully penetrate and bond with the fabric fibers, ensuring a durable, even coating. Here’s why:**

* **Improves wax adhesion and penetration deeper than surface melting alone**
  The prolonged, even heat allows the wax to soften and flow into the microscopic gaps within the fabric weave, not just sit on top. This deeper penetration creates a stronger mechanical bond between the wax and fibers, making it less likely to flake or wear off.

* **Enhances water repellency and abrasion resistance**
  When wax is thoroughly absorbed and evenly distributed throughout the fabric, it forms a continuous hydrophobic barrier. This reduces water absorption and also means the wax layer is more resistant to mechanical wear, because it’s supported by the fibers themselves, not just coating the surface.

* **Helps the wax harden uniformly for long-lasting performance**
  The sauna provides stable, even heat that fully melts and saturates the wax into the fabric uniformly, preventing uneven buildup. After heating, the wax cools gradually at ambient temperature. This slow cooling avoids rapid temperature changes that could cause cracks or weak spots, resulting in a flexible yet durable coating that protects the fabric during movement and abrasion.

### Alternative Curing Methods

A regular oven set to 100 °C with a baking sheet or silicone mat might work for curing as well. However, due to fire and melting risks, this method is **not recommended** and should only be attempted with caution. Never leave the oven unattended while curing.

## Washing Resistance
Field Mantle has undergone testing in which garments were washed twice at a temperature of 30°C without using fabric softener. After these washes, the treated fabric maintained its ability to bead water just as effectively as on the day it was applied.

## Field Testing

Field Mantle is tested in real-world outdoor conditions, including:

- Light to moderate rain
  - **Faster post-rain drying:** After an hour in light rain, treated garments typically dry indoors within about 30 minutes, reducing downtime in the field.
- Cold and hot weather field exercises
- Abrasion from packs and gear
- Multiple wash cycles

## Understanding Fabric Weave and Water Penetration

Fabric is made up of woven fibers that create tiny gaps or pores. Typically, these pores are larger than water molecules which allows water to pass through them when under pressure such as heavy rain, wind-driven moisture, or sitting on a wet surface. However, light contact like splashes or pouring water slowly is often effectively repelled by hydrophobic treatments.

**The role of fabric waxes:**
Field Mantle wax fills and coats the fibers and gaps in the fabric, creating a water-repellent barrier that helps resist water absorption during everyday use, particularly against light to moderate rain and splashes. Nonetheless, under sustained pressure or harsh conditions, water can still seep through.

**Managing expectations:**
Wax treatments enhance water repellency but do not guarantee full waterproofing. Tightly woven fabrics perform better with wax treatments. For complete waterproofing, specialized membranes or coatings are necessary.

Understanding the structure of fabric helps explain why Field Mantle achieves a great balance between breathability, durability, and water resistance.

## Fabric Compatibility

Field Mantle works well on various fabrics such as natural fibers like cotton, canvas, denim, poly-cotton blends, and some polyester fabrics. When it comes to leather, there are specific instructions for proper wax treatment application to ensure the best results.

To maintain the integrity of your leather piece, apply a quality leather conditioner first to restore natural oils and keep the material supple. Once fully absorbed, proceed with applying the wax treatment. Use a heat gun on a low-to-medium setting, making quick, sweeping passes to melt and set the wax while keeping the tool in constant motion to prevent overheating. Note that waxing will result in a slight darkening of the leather's color. Furthermore, avoid using prolonged, high heat and refrain from the sauna method, as excessive heat can dry out and damage leather fibers.

> **Note:** When applying to polyester or synthetic-rich fabrics, reduce the heat gun temperature to avoid melting or damaging the fibers. Pay special attention to Velcro (hook-and-loop) closures — even a few seconds of excessive heat can soften and fuse the hooks, leaving pockets or flaps with little to no grip.
