# Field Mantle

**High-performance fabric wax for weatherproofing, abrasion resistance, and field conditions.**

Field Mantle is a rub-on wax blend designed for outdoor and tactical fabrics. It delivers lasting water repellency and fiber protection — without relying on synthetic coatings that flake or wash away.

The current release uses a balanced blend of **beeswax, paraffin, and carnauba wax**, optimized for weatherproofing, durability, wash resistance, and dirt repellency.

## Why This Blend Works

- **Beeswax** – Creates a natural, flexible waterproof layer.
- **Paraffin** – Penetrates deeper into fibers, improving flexibility and boosting water repellency.
- **Carnauba Wax** – Hardens the finish, improves abrasion resistance, and extends service life.

Unlike many commercial wax treatments that tend to attract and hold dirt, accelerating fabric wear through abrasion, Field Mantle’s carefully balanced blend creates a durable, smooth coating that resists dirt buildup. This reduces fabric abrasion and prolongs garment life, even in harsh field conditions.

The result is a coating that:
- Repels water effectively — even after multiple machine washes at 30 °C (without fabric softener).
- Withstands field abrasion better than beeswax-only formulas.
- Remains flexible in cold weather yet resists softening in heat.
- Minimizes dirt adhesion, preventing accelerated fabric wear.

## Making a Batch

> **Safety note:** Always use a double boiler — never melt wax directly over a flame.

For easy calculation of ingredient quantities based on your desired batch size,
use the Wax Batch Calculator.xlsx included in this repo.

1. **Ingredients** (by weight):
   - 50% Beeswax
   - 25% Paraffin
   - 25% Carnauba Wax

2. **Steps**:
   1. Add all ingredients to a double boiler.
   2. Heat gently until fully melted.
   3. Stir thoroughly to ensure a uniform blend.
   4. Pour into silicone muffin molds (or other heat-safe molds).
   5. Allow to cool and solidify before storage.

> **Cleanup Note:**
The wax blend hardens firmly, making cleanup challenging. It’s best to use dedicated cookware—both for melting (double boiler) and stirring—as well as silicone molds for pouring. A stainless steel scourer helps remove most residue, but some will remain.

## Application

1. **Rub** a thin, even layer of Field Mantle onto the fabric surface.
2. **Heat** the treated area with a heat gun until the wax fully melts into the fibers.
3. **Cure** by placing the garment in a 100 °C sauna for 4 hours.
4. Allow to cool completely before use.

### Why Sauna Curing?

**The 4-hour sauna curing at 100 °C helps the wax fully penetrate and bond with the fabric fibers, ensuring a durable, even coating. Here’s why:**

* **Improves wax adhesion and penetration deeper than surface melting alone**
  The prolonged, even heat allows the wax to soften and flow into the microscopic gaps within the fabric weave, not just sit on top. This deeper penetration creates a stronger mechanical bond between the wax and fibers, making it less likely to flake or wear off.

* **Enhances water repellency and abrasion resistance**
  When wax is thoroughly absorbed and evenly distributed throughout the fabric, it forms a continuous hydrophobic barrier. This reduces water absorption and also means the wax layer is more resistant to mechanical wear, because it’s supported by the fibers themselves, not just coating the surface.

* **Helps the wax harden uniformly for long-lasting performance**
  The sauna provides stable, even heat that fully melts and saturates the wax into the fabric uniformly, preventing uneven buildup. After heating, the wax cools gradually at ambient temperature. This slow cooling avoids rapid temperature changes that could cause cracks or weak spots, resulting in a flexible yet durable coating that protects the fabric during movement and abrasion.

## Washing Resistance
Field Mantle has been tested on garments washed twice at 30 °C without fabric softener, and after washing, the treated fabric continued to bead water as effectively as on the day of application.

## Field Testing

Field Mantle is tested in real-world outdoor conditions, including:
- Light to moderate rain
- Cold and hot weather field exercises
- Abrasion from packs and gear
- Multiple wash cycles

## Understanding Fabric Weave and Water Penetration

Fabric consists of woven fibers creating tiny gaps or pores. In most fabrics, these pores are larger than water molecules.

**Why water gets through:**
When water is pushed by pressure—such as heavy rain, wind-driven moisture, or body movement—it can pass through these pores. Light contact, like splashes or pouring water slowly, is often repelled effectively by a hydrophobic treatment.

**What fabric waxes do:**
Field Mantle wax fills and coats fibers and gaps, creating a water-repellent barrier. This helps resist water absorption during everyday use, especially against light to moderate rain and splashes. However, under sustained pressure or harsh conditions, water can still penetrate.

**Setting realistic expectations:**

* Wax treatments improve water repellency but don’t guarantee total waterproofing.
* Tightly woven fabrics perform better with wax treatments.
* For full waterproofing, specialized membranes or coatings are necessary.

Understanding fabric structure helps explain why Field Mantle balances breathability, durability, and water resistance so well.

## Fabric Compatibility

Field Mantle works well on natural fibers like cotton and canvas, as well as poly-cotton blends and some polyester fabrics.

> **Note:** When applying to polyester or synthetic-rich fabrics, reduce the heat gun temperature to avoid melting or damaging the fibers.
